# CollabHub

CollabHub is a platform designed to connect developers and help them find the right collaborators for their projects. Unlike traditional job portals, CollabHub emphasizes collaboration and building connections tailored to developers' skills, interests, and project needs.

- **Skill-Based Matching:** Use advanced algorithms to find collaborators with the skills you need.
- **Project Showcasing:** Share your project and attract contributors who are genuinely interested.
- **Networking Opportunities:** Build meaningful connections within the developer community.
- **Rich Text Descriptions:** Use BlockNote (based on Tiptap Editor) to create engaging and detailed self-descriptions or project overviews.
- **AI Assistance:** Integrated Gemini 1.5 Flash model to help users refine their profiles and clearly explain their intended project roles.
- **Secure Authentication:** GitHub OAuth integration for a seamless and secure sign-in experience.
